## Intro

Every dashboard (web app) can be build only with Python. No knowledge of web programming (CSS and JavaScript) is required.

Two things to keep in mind:

* Components (controls): allow you to increase the interactivity of your app.
* Callbacks: actual functions that should be called when some interaction happens.
