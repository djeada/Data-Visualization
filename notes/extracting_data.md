## Extracting data
It is one of the most difficult tasks.
Before you can plot data, it must first be prepared in such a way that it is even possible.

The information could be:

* dispersed over various applications.
* replicated across multiple databases.
* insufficient (some entries might be missing).
* textual (you have to somehow convert it to a number).
* stored in a variety of formats.

## Tabular data

Most data (from wherever it comes) can be transformed to tabular form.
