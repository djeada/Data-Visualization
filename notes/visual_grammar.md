Set of rules and practices used in order to maximize the impact of a visual presentation.

## Color, shape, size and proximity

* Color can be used to direct attention and distinguish between types.
* Distinct shapes indicate that the data is divided into different groups.
* The size of an element indicates to the user how significant it is. 
* Grouping similar objects shows that they are related.

## Hierarchy

* Helps to show how different ideas fit together.
* Could be visualized trough a tree (e.g. deicsion trees).

## Emphasis

* If one piece is more significant than the rest, it should be highlighted.

## Abstraction

* You need to abstract the details to show the viewer what's important.
