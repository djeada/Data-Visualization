# Data-Visualisation
Code snippets and thoughts on data visualization.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to collect short code snippets demonstrating the advantages and limitations of various data visualization frameworks, as well as my thoughts on data visualization in general. 

## Where to find data?

* https://data.gov/https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlotshttps://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+

## How do I run the notebooks?

You do not need to install anything locally on your PC. You may run all of the examples on the official website of Jupyter Notebooks using a demo version:
