# Data Visualization Guide and Code Snippets

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to the exploration of various data visualization frameworks through bite-sized code snippets, as well as providing insights on effective data visualization techniques and principles. 

## üéØ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to serve as a practical guide for understanding the strengths and drawbacks of diverse data visualization frameworks. Additionally, it encompasses my own reflections on the topic of data visualization.

## üìö Data Sources

Looking for datasets to use for your visualization practices? Here are a few online sources to obtain public datasets:

- [Scikit-Learn Toy Datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html)
- [Tableau Public Data Sets](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/free-public-data-sets)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Google Cloud Public Datasets](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset)
- [U.S. Government's Open Data](https://data.gov/)
- [Awesome Public Datasets on GitHub](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Ensure that you have Python 3.8 or above installed to execute the notebooks.

## üöÄ Running Notebooks

To run these notebooks, you have two options:

1. **Online:** You can use the official Jupyter Notebooks online platform without installing anything on your local machine. Try it out here:

    [Jupyter Notebook Demo](https://jupyter.org/try)

2. **Locally:** If you wish to run notebooks on your local machine, follow the steps below:

    - Clone the repository: 
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/djeada/Data-Visualization.git
      ```
    - Navigate to the cloned repository:
      ```
      cd Data-Visualization
      ```
    - Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't done so already:
      ```
      pip install notebook
      ```
    - Run Jupyter Notebook:
      ```
      jupyter notebook
      ```
